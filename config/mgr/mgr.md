| <span id="SP_mgr_data">mgr_data</span> |  Filesystem path to the ceph-mgr data directory, used to contain keyring. | Advanced | Str | /var/lib/ceph/mgr/$cluster-$id |  |  |  |  |  |  | NO_MON_UPDATE | mgr |  |  |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_debug_aggressive_pg_num_changes">mgr_debug_aggressive_pg_num_changes</span> |  Bypass most throttling and safety checks in pg[p]_num controller | Dev | Bool | False |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | mgr |  |  |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_disabled_modules">mgr_disabled_modules</span> |  List of manager modules never get loaded | Advanced | Str | mgr_disabled_modules |  |  |  |  |  | [[mgr_module_path](/mgr/mgr.md#SP_mgr_module_path)] | STARTUP | mgr |  | A comma delimited list of module names. This list is read by manager when it starts. By default, manager loads all modules found in specified 'mgr_module_path', and it starts the enabled ones as instructed. The modules in this list will not be loaded at all. |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_initial_modules">mgr_initial_modules</span> |  List of manager modules to enable when the cluster is first started | Basic | Str | restful iostat nfs |  |  |  |  |  |  | NO_MON_UPDATECLUSTER_CREATE | ["mon", "common"] |  | This list of module names is read by the monitor when the cluster is first started after installation, to populate the list of enabled manager modules.  Subsequent updates are done using the 'mgr module [enable|disable]' commands.  List may be comma or space separated. |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_max_pg_num_change">mgr_max_pg_num_change</span> |  maximum change in pg_num | Advanced | Int | 128 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | mgr |  |  |  |

| <span id="SP_mgr_service_beacon_grace">mgr_service_beacon_grace</span> |  Period in seconds from last beacon to manager dropping state about a monitored service (RGW, rbd-mirror etc) | Advanced | Float | 1_min |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | mgr |  |  |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_standby_modules">mgr_standby_modules</span> |  Start modules in standby (redirect) mode when mgr is standby | Advanced | Bool | True |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | By default, the standby modules will answer incoming requests with a HTTP redirect to the active manager, allowing users to point their browser at any mgr node and find their way to an active mgr.  However, this mode is problematic when using a load balancer because (1) the redirect locations are usually private IPs and (2) the load balancer can't identify which mgr is the right one to send traffic to. If a load balancer is being used, set this to false. |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_stats_period">mgr_stats_period</span> |  Period in seconds of OSD/MDS stats reports to manager | Basic | Int | 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ["mgr", "common"] |  | Use this setting to control the granularity of time series data collection from daemons.  Adjust upwards if the manager CPU load is too high, or if you simply do not require the most up to date performance counter data. |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_stats_threshold">mgr_stats_threshold</span> |  Lowest perfcounter priority collected by mgr | Advanced | Int | 5 |  | 0 | 11 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Daemons only set perf counter data to the manager daemon if the counter has a priority higher than this. |  |
| <span id="SP_mgr_tick_period">mgr_tick_period</span> |  Period in seconds of beacon messages to monitor | Advanced | Secs | 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ["mgr", "mon"] |  |  |  |
