When disabled, the number of concurrent requests will be limited by the thread count, but debugging and tracing the synchronous calls can be easier. |  |

| <span id="SP_rgw_cache_expiry_interval">rgw_cache_expiry_interval</span> |  Number of seconds before entries in the cache are assumed stale and re-fetched. Zero is never. | Advanced | Uint | 900 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ["rgw", "rgw"] |  | The Rados Gateway stores metadata and objects in an internal cache. This should be kept consistent by the OSD's relaying notify events between multiple watching RGW processes. In the event that this notification protocol fails, bounding the length of time that any data in the cache will be assumed valid will ensure that any RGW instance that falls out of sync will eventually recover. This seems to be an issue mostly for large numbers of RGW instances under heavy use. If you would like to turn off cache expiry, set this value to zero. | performance |

When this option is set, the ops log will log operations that are sent to non existing buckets. These operations inherently fail, and do not correspond to a specific user. |  |

RGW read and write operations will never request more than this amount in a single request. This also defines the RGW head object size, as head operations need to be atomic, and anything larger than this would require more than a single operation. When RGW objects are written to the default storage class, up to this amount of payload data will be stored alongside metadata in the head object. |  |

A higher number of control objects allows better concurrency of these messages, at the cost of more resource utilization. |  |
