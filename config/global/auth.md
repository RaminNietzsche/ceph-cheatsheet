| <span id="SP_auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim">auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim</span> |  Allow reclaiming global_id without presenting a valid ticket proving previous possession of that global_id | Advanced | Bool | True |  |  |  |  |  | [[mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim](~/config/global/mon#SP_mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim), [mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim_allowed](~/config/global/mon#SP_mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim_allowed), [auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim](~/config/global/auth#SP_auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim)] |  |  |  | Allowing unauthorized global_id (re)use poses a security risk. Unfortunately, older clients may omit their ticket on reconnects and therefore rely on this being allowed for preserving their global_id for the lifetime of the client instance. Setting this value to false would immediately prevent new connections from those clients (assuming auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim set to true) and eventually break existing sessions as well (regardless of auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim setting). |  |

In enforcing mode (auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim set to false), this is a fail-fast mechanism: don't establish a session that will almost inevitably be broken later. |  |
