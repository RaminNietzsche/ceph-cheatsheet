| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_action_update_interval">cephfs_mirror_action_update_interval</span> |  interval for driving asynchronous mirror actions | Advanced | Secs | 2 |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | Interval in seconds to process pending mirror update actions. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_directory_scan_interval">cephfs_mirror_directory_scan_interval</span> |  interval to scan directories to mirror snapshots | Advanced | Uint | 10 |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | interval in seconds to scan configured directories for snapshot mirroring. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_max_concurrent_directory_syncs">cephfs_mirror_max_concurrent_directory_syncs</span> |  maximum number of concurrent snapshot synchronization threads | Advanced | Uint | 3 |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | maximum number of directory snapshots that can be synchronized concurrently by cephfs-mirror daemon. Controls the number of synchronization threads. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_max_consecutive_failures_per_directory">cephfs_mirror_max_consecutive_failures_per_directory</span> |  consecutive failed directory synchronization attempts before marking a directory as \"failed | Advanced | Uint | 10 |  | 0 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | number of consecutive snapshot synchronization failures to mark a directory as \"failed\". failed directories are retried for synchronization less frequently. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_max_snapshot_sync_per_cycle">cephfs_mirror_max_snapshot_sync_per_cycle</span> |  number of snapshots to mirror in one cycle | Advanced | Uint | 3 |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | maximum number of snapshots to mirror when a directory is picked up for mirroring by worker threads. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_mount_timeout">cephfs_mirror_mount_timeout</span> |  timeout for mounting primary/secondary ceph file system | Advanced | Secs | 10 |  | 0 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | Timeout in seconds for mounting primary or secondary (remote) ceph file system by the cephfs-mirror daemon. Setting this to a higher value could result in the mirror daemon getting stalled when mounting a file system if the cluster is not reachable. This option is used to override the usual client_mount_timeout. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_restart_mirror_on_blocklist_interval">cephfs_mirror_restart_mirror_on_blocklist_interval</span> |  interval to restart blocklisted instances | Advanced | Secs | 30 |  | 0 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | Interval in seconds to restart blocklisted mirror instances. Setting to zero (0) disables restarting blocklisted instances. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_restart_mirror_on_failure_interval">cephfs_mirror_restart_mirror_on_failure_interval</span> |  interval to restart failed mirror instances | Advanced | Secs | 20 |  | 0 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | Interval in seconds to restart failed mirror instances. Setting to zero (0) disables restarting failed mirror instances. |  |
| <span id="SP_cephfs_mirror_retry_failed_directories_interval">cephfs_mirror_retry_failed_directories_interval</span> |  failed directory retry interval for synchronization | Advanced | Uint | 60 |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | cephfs-mirror |  | interval in seconds to retry synchronization for failed directories. |  |
